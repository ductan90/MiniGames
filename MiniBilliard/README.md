# MiniBilliard

This is a mini version of billiards.You must shoot a ball in order to hit another pink ball which is existing on the table at the beginning of the game. The goal of this game is to let the pink ball(by alpha blending) fall into one of the six holes.


Use the space key to shoot a ball. I use a rectangle to simulate a player. The pin is to simulate the stick. You can use [left arrow] and [right arrow] to move the player and [up arrow] and [down arrow] to adjust the stick.


You can use [ctrl] to draw an aim line(Stipple) in order to aim the target. However, the aim line is only a simulation in ideal situation. You should not rely on this. Because the ball is moving with fraction.


You can exit the game at any time by pressing [ESC].
